    <h2>Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning</h2>
    <p class="nav1">Phishing is still a major concern in the digital world because it uses fraud to obtain private information from people who are not careful. The advanced nature of phishing schemes is always improving, and traditional anti-phishing methods find it difficult to stay up. As a reaction, this study uses machine learning to provide an alternative way of identifying phishing websites. Specifically, we suggest a hybrid model that combines the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithms and we achived good accuracy is 97.1%.</p>
    <!-- <p class="nav1">Phishing is a cybercrime that involves the use of fraudulent emails, messages, and websites to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details and other personal data.</p> -->

    <p class="nav2">We used a hybrid approach in our experimentation to enhance the effectiveness and performance of our machine-learning models.  Using soft voting techniques, we combined the Gradient Boosting Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, SVM, and MLP Classifier into a single ensemble model,  which we refer to as (gbc+catboosting+svm+mlp). A process known as "soft voting" entails averaging the outputs of several models to combine their predictions.  By using this method to optimize the model's hyperparameters, we were able to find and pick the most informative features.  In our experimental evaluations, we were able to attain an accuracy rate of 97.1%.</p>
